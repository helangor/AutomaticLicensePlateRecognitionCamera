# Automatic Licence Plate Recognition Camera with AWS
Small Python script that uses Raspberry Pi and Camera to take a photo of a car in front of you -> program recognizes license plate automatically and output is the data of the car shown in GUI.
It might not be the most sophisticated code, but the most important thing is that it does what it was supposed to do and I learned a lot by building this project. 

### Hardware that I used
- Raspberry Pi
- Nikon D3300 with 18-55 mm AF-P DX

#### Why I made this project
I wanted to try if it would be possible to automate my car data system completely. So you only press button and the end result would be data of the car in GUI. 

#### What I learned 
I learned to use AWS cloud capabilities like Rekognition and S3
How to use Raspberry to control DSLR camera.
